# Rental Backend

This repository contains the implementation of a backend using Django REST Framework. It provides a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs with Django, enabling easy creation of web APIs following the REST principles.

## Features

- **Django Integration:** Built on top of Django, leveraging its robustness and scalability.
- **RESTful API:** Utilizes Django REST Framework to create RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **Authentication:** Supports various authentication methods including token-based authentication, session authentication, OAuth, etc.
- **Serialization:** Provides powerful serialization for converting complex data types, such as querysets and model instances, to native Python datatypes and vice versa.
- **Browsable API:** Offers a web-based API browser for easy exploration and testing of API endpoints.
- **Customizable:** Easily customizable and extendable according to project requirements.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run migrations:**

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Create a superuser (optional):**

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints using tools like `curl`, Postman, or any HTTP client. The API endpoints will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`.

To access the browsable API, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/api/` in your web browser. Here, you can explore the available endpoints, interact with them, and test the API.

## Configuration

- **Settings:** Modify the `settings.py` file to configure various aspects of the Django project including database settings, installed apps, middleware, etc.
- **URLs:** Define API endpoints and URL patterns in the `urls.py` file within the Django app.
- **Models:** Define database models in the `models.py` file within the Django app.
- **Views:** Create views to handle HTTP requests and responses in the `views.py` file within the Django app.
- **Serializers:** Define serializers to convert complex data types to native Python datatypes and vice versa in the `serializers.py` file within the Django app.
